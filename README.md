I have created a fully dynamic and responsive portfolio website that showcases my skills, creativity, and projects. The portfolio is designed with modern UI/UX principles, smooth animations, and optimized performance to provide an engaging user experience across all devices.

It includes structured sections such as Home, About, Experience, Projects, Resume, and Connect, along with interactive features like animated transitions, dynamic content rendering, and a functional contact form for direct messaging.

Built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript, the portfolio emphasizes responsiveness, minimalism, and accessibility while maintaining a professional aesthetic.
